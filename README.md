# lv_cxx_binding
A C++ binding generator for LVGL. Written in Rust (oh the irony)

This generator uses tree-sitter to efficiently construct an AST of all the headers
in LVGL source code, that will later be analyzed, and used as a basis for all
autogenerated C++ code.

## Process

In short, the whole process can be simplified to 3 main steps:

- Parsing
- Grouping
- Generation

The first step is responsible for getting the raw source code, turning it into
an AST, and extracting all functions/constants/typedefs/etc into a list.

The second step then groups all items inside that list in, well, groups, for
example "this group of functions should result in a class", or "this group
of functions should result in a namespace" etc.

And the best for last, the third step consists of actually converting allat into
actual C++ code. That shit is done manually, for plain efficiency and also ease
of understanding what is actually going on. Also, an additional `clang-format`
run can be named a "three and a half" step, because it's part of codegen, but not
part of the actual generator.
